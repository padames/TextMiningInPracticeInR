<h1 id="analysis-from-a-clean-data-file-of-delta-airlines">Analysis from a clean data file of Delta Airlines</h1>
<p>This text mining exercise of a curated sample of 15 days of Tweets from October 2015 from the Delta Airlines Customer Service team looks to answer a few relevant questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the average length of the customer service reply in this social media platform?</li>
<li>What links were referenced most often?</li>
<li>How many social media responses per customer service representative are reasonable?</li>
<li>How many team members are needed for a similar size of operation?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these can be addressed without the full data mining preprocessing, actually the dates are useful for identifying weekly patterns for the user interaction load through this platform. This could be the case if one wanted to go deeper into question 3 to assess the workforce required for weekends in contrast to weekdays. These questions can be answered before doing the preparation and cleaning steps, however, for the sake of completeness and comparison, those steps are shown below first.</p>
<h1 id="preparing-and-cleaning-the-data">Preparing and Cleaning the data</h1>
<p>The data for these exercises in text mining can be found in <a href="https://github.com/kwartler/text_mining">Ted Kwartler's Github repo</a>. The tweets are curated by carefully filtering those for the month of October, 2015. Their date is part of the information collected. It's a good idea to fork the original repo and use the forked version in case the original author takes his repo down.</p>
<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>
<p>The most straight forward approach to fetching the data directly from a Github repository and reading it into a comma separated text file, is to use the curl library through R. The main advantage is that curl identifies the type of content and parses it correctly without much intervention from the user. Care should be taken to reference the <strong>raw</strong> version of the text file, instead of the html rendition of it that the hosting website provides to display the information in a human readable form through web browsers.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">text.df &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">read.csv</span>(<span class="kw">curl</span>(<span class="st">&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/padames/text_mining/master/oct_delta.csv&quot;</span>),

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Size of data frame read in KB: 256.2&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Number of rows and columns in data frame: (1377,5)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The columns in this data frame are five: weekday, month, date, year, text. Only the last one is required to continue doing the text mining of the tweets. Thus, a data frame with only the columns <code>doc_id</code> and <code>text</code> is created to use as input for the functions in the <code>tm</code> package.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">df &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">data.frame</span>(<span class="dt">doc_id =</span> <span class="kw">seq</span>(<span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="kw">nrow</span>(text.df)), <span class="co"># a numeric index</span>
                 <span class="dt">text =</span> text.df<span class="op">$</span>text) <span class="co"># the vector of 1377 tweets</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2>
<p>The latest version of <code>tm</code>, 0.7-6, changed the way the virtual corpus is created by eliminating the need for a reader closure to be provided with information on the columns to be parsed as the index and the actual text. Now, provided the data frame has the names <code>doc_id</code> and <code>text</code>, the function will be able to extarct the information correctly.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">corpus &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">VCorpus</span>(<span class="kw">DataframeSource</span>(df))</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2>
<p>The corpus is cleaned up using auxiliary functions found in the external file <code>Helpers.R</code> which is sourced at the beginning of this file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">corpus.clean &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">clean.corpus</span>(corpus)</code></pre></div>
<p>To test that we really clean the corpus a simple test is run, you can try different values of <code>tweet_number</code> between 1 and 1377:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">tweet_number =<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">1045</span>
not_cleaned &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>corpus[tweet_number][[<span class="dv">1</span>]]<span class="op">$</span>content
cleaned &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>corpus.clean[tweet_number][[<span class="dv">1</span>]]<span class="op">$</span>content
test_of_equality &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="op">!</span>(<span class="kw">identical</span>( cleaned, not_cleaned))</code></pre></div>
<p>The tests give the following results for tweet number 1045:</p>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Tweet &#39;1045&#39; was cleaned: TRUE&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;tweet[&#39;1045&#39;] original; @Kyrrie_Twin Kyrrie, what will the compensation be for? *VM&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;tweet[&#39;1045&#39;] cleaned; kyrrietwin kyrrie will compensation vm&quot;</code></pre>
<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>
<p>Here are answers from doing some text digging.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-average-length-of-the-customer-service-reply-in-this-social-media-platform">What is the average length of the customer service reply in this social media platform?</h2>
<p>Assuming that each tweet represents one single interaction with a customer then the average length of each represents the answer to this question. Tweet limits the length of each response to a maximum of 280 characters (<a href="https://bgr.com/2018/02/08/twitter-character-limit-280-vs-140-user-engagement/" title="Tweeter increases length">Tweeter increases length</a>).</p>
<p>Working on the original Tweets, inspection of the data frame shows that the column named <code>text</code> has all the tweets. Since it is a vector of strings the vectorized funcion <code>nchar</code> can be used to read the length in characters of each tweet and return a vector of those values. After that calculating their mean is straight forward:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">round</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> <span class="kw">mean</span>(<span class="kw">nchar</span>(text.df<span class="op">$</span>text)), <span class="dt">digits =</span> <span class="dv">0</span>)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 92</code></pre>
<p>Now for comparison let's look at the average number of characters after cleaning the tweets for bag of words text mining:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">clean.dataframe &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">data.frame</span>(<span class="dt">text =</span> <span class="kw">unlist</span>(<span class="kw">sapply</span>(corpus.clean, <span class="st">`</span><span class="dt">[</span><span class="st">`</span>, <span class="st">&quot;content&quot;</span>)))
<span class="kw">round</span>(<span class="kw">mean</span>(<span class="kw">nchar</span>(clean.dataframe[,<span class="dv">1</span>])), <span class="dt">digits =</span> <span class="dv">0</span>)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 60</code></pre>
<p>A substantial reduction in verbosity but not as good an indicator of how much it is needed to communicate with humans using Tweeter.</p>
<h2 id="what-links-were-referenced-most-often">What links were referenced most often?</h2>
<p>Ted Kwartler suggests on page 35 of his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Text-Mining-Practice-Ted-Kwartler/dp/1119282012">book</a> that references encompass a phone number or a web site. These would be ways to refer a customer to contact the Customer Service at Delta directly, or to visit a FAQ page on the Delta Airlines website.</p>

<p>For this Ted Kwartler suggests on page 32 of his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Text-Mining-Practice-Ted-Kwartler/dp/1119282012">book</a>, using a function to detect the last two characters of every tweet, hoping to capture the initials used for each agent.

<p>The average response per agent over 15 days is 42 with Kwartler's function and 37 with the new code using library <code>stringi</code>'s function. Either way agent <code>pl</code> seems to be the hardest working in the group with 104 responses over this period. If especific work loads needed to be analyzed on particular peridos of time like weekends then the original data frame needs to be subset based on the time window to be considered.</p>
<p>Some tweets are continuations of previous ones and they end with <code>\2</code> or <code>\3</code> to indicate the sequence after the agent's two-letter signature, this would require further examination to see how it affects the averages computed here. Numbers and other symbols are removed in the clean up procedure so this would have to be done on the original tweets.</p>

<p>According to Kwartler calculations there are 33 agents to process 1009 interactions through Tweeter. The new code indicated 37 agents processing 1169 interactions over the 15 days of data availble.</p>

<p>The mean term frequency is 4. Considering the 20 most frequent words reveals nothing alien to the context of an airline customer service operation. However it can be inferred that many of the interactions on the platform are related to correcting or acknowledging errors or inconveniences for the customers as the words <em>sorry</em> and <em>apology</em> appears so prominently.</p>
